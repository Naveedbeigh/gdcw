                <p>Schools in India are opening after 18 months of closure and the season of festivals brings hope of resuming business and work for many families devasted by the pandemic and lockdowns.  However, hopes of returning to school for many children in India have been tempered by the realities of the pandemic.  With their parents losing paid work or worse, dying from COVID-19, children and especially girls, must sacrifice their education to contribute to the family income by entering the workforce and/ or marrying early.

                    Sadly, the last couple of decades of progress in education for girls, poor, and rural children across India is waning while child labor, child marriage, and child trafficking are all on the rise. An article in the LA Times tells the story of Patole, a 17-year-old girl who was previously in school but due to her father’s death from COVID-19, she will now join her mother as a migrant worker harvesting sugar cane this fall.  Despite child labor being technically illegal, Patole is one of millions of child-laborers, according to the author David Pierson “She and millions of other school-age rural children are in danger of becoming a lost generation — locked out of the classroom for so long that they tumble into lives of deprivation and struggle that previously doomed their parents.”  An article in the East Asia Forum by Monika Chaudhary highlights the regression of progress for girls education in India which had made great strides as of 2018. “The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the critical progress that has been achieved. Up to 10 million girls are at risk of dropping out of secondary school due to the pandemic.” The impact on rural children is far worse and most do not have access to internet and online learning.

                    Patole’s father and mother supported her education, and desired for her to one day escape the poverty they have always known.  The communities YGB supports in West Bengal, Mysore and Chamarajanagara, Karanataka have many of the same hopes and face the same challenges as Patole and her family– namely economic devastation, lack of access to remote learning and technology, and generational gender and socio-economic discrimination in education accesses</p>

                <p>A definite article is an article that marks a definite noun phrase. Definite articles such as English the are used to refer to a particular member of a group . It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned or it may be otherwise something uniquely specified.

                    For example, Sentence 1 uses the definite article and thus expresses a request for a particular book. In contrast, Sentence 2 uses an indefinite article and thus conveys that the speaker would be satisfied with any book.

                    Give me the book.
                    Give me a book.
                    The definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:

                    The cabbage white butterfly lays its eggs on members of the Brassica genus.
                    However, recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to certain noun types due to lexicalization. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article.</p>
