However, hopes of returning to school for many children in India have been tempered by the realities of the pandemic.  With their parents losing paid work or worse, dying from COVID-19, children and especially girls, must sacrifice their education to contribute to the family income by entering the workforce and/ or marrying early.\r\n\r\n                    Sadly, the last couple of decades of progress in education for girls, poor, and rural children across India is waning while child labor, child marriage, and child trafficking are all on the rise. An article in the LA Times tells the story of Patole, a 17-year-old girl who was previously in school but due to her father’s death from COVID-19, she will now join her mother as a migrant worker harvesting sugar cane this fall.  Despite child labor being technically illegal, Patole is one of millions of child-laborers, according to the author David Pierson “She and millions of other school-age rural children are in danger of becoming a lost generation — locked out of the classroom for so long that they tumble into lives of deprivation and struggle that previously doomed their parents.”  An article in the East Asia Forum by Monika Chaudhary highlights the regression of progress for girls education in India which had made great strides as of 2018. “The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging the critical progress that has been achieved. Up to 10 million girls are at risk of dropping out of secondary school due to the pandemic.” The impact on rural children is far worse and most do not have access to internet and online learning.\r\n\r\n                    Patole’s father and mother supported her education, and desired for her to one day escape the poverty they have always known.  The communities YGB supports in West Bengal, Mysore and Chamarajanagara, Karanataka have many of the same hopes and face the same challenges as Patole and her family– namely economic devastation, lack of access to remote learning and technology, and generational gender and socio-economic discrimination in education accesses</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\nexport function AboutJournal() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <>\r\n            <div className=\"body\">\r\n                <h3>About Journal</h3>\r\n                <Divider variant=\"middle\" />\r\n                <p>A definite article is an article that marks a definite noun phrase.

Literacy and knowledge we believe cannot thrive and grow in a world of web bots, web crawlers, or AI. This requires human curiosity, human learning, and human imagination.

One has to have a mind that is crystal clear, only then can truth shine in it.” Every contribution whether big or small is precious- in this crisis and ahead.</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n","import Home, { AboutJournal, AdvisoryBoard, EditorialBoard, Guidelines, Policy, Volumes } from \"./Body\";\r\nimport {\r\n    BrowserRouter as Router,\r\n    Switch,\r\n    Route,\r\n    Link\r\n} from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport Announcement from \"./Announcements\";\r\nexport default function navbar() {\r\n    return (\r\n\r\n        <Router>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"navbar\">\r\n                <li><Link to=\"/\">Home</Link></li>\r\n                <li class=\"dropdown\">\r\n                    <Link to=\"/AboutJournal\">About journal</Link>\r\n                    <li class=\"dropdown-content\">\r\n                        <Link to=\"/AboutJournal\">About journal</Link>\r\n                        <Link to=\"/Volumes\">Volumes</Link>\r\n                    </li>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li><Link to=\"/EditorialBoard\">Editorial Board</Link></li>\r\n                <li><Link to=\"/AdvisoryBoard\">Advisory Board</Link></li>\r\n                <li><Link to=\"/Policy\">Policy</Link></li>\r\n                <li><Link to=\"/Guidelines\">Guidelines</Link></li>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"flex\">\r\n                <div className=\"main\">\r\n\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <Switch>\r\n\r\n                            <Route path=\"/AboutJournal\">\r\n                                <AboutJournal />\r\n                            </Route>\r\n                            <Route path=\"/Volumes\">\r\n                                <Volumes />\r\n                            </Route>\r\n                            <Route path=\"/EditorialBoard\">\r\n                                <EditorialBoard />\r\n                            </Route>\r\n                            <Route path=\"/AdvisoryBoard\">\r\n                                <AdvisoryBoard />\r\n                            </Route>\r\n                            <Route path=\"/Policy\">\r\n                                <Policy />\r\n                            </Route>\r\n                            <Route path=\"/Guidelines\">\r\n                                <Guidelines />\r\n                            </Route>\r\n                            <Route path=\"/\">\r\n                                <Home />\r\n                            </Route>\r\n                        </Switch>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"sidebar\">\r\n\r\n                    <div><div>  <Announcement /> </div></div>\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n        </Router>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    )\r\n}","\r\nexport default function Footer() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <>\r\n            <div className=\"\">\r\n                <div className=\" flexfoot\">\r\n                    <li>Contact us</li>\r\n                    <li>Department</li>\r\n                    <li>College</li>\r\n                   \r\n                   \r\n                </div>\r\n               \r\n            </div>\r\n        </>\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n","\nimport Header from './componants/Header';\nimport './App.css';\nimport Navbar from './componants/Navbar';\nimport Footer from './componants/Footer';\n\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Header />\n      <Navbar />\n\n\n      <Footer />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
